These are some QtCreator .user files used by us to compile the project.
Separate configurations are used for Windows / Linux / Mac OSx machines.

Place the Phoenard_Toolkit_[os].pro.user in the src directory.
Then remove the _[os] part from the name. For example, copy and rename:

> Phoenard_Toolkit/src/Phoenard_Toolkit.pro.user

You might need to make additional changes to make it work on your machine.
